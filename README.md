# Bootcamp-Project-1-Python

## Project#1
Based on what youâ€™ve learned until now, create a project of your choosing (impress us
with your imagination). This project must at least satisfy the following minimum requirements:
- Use at least 3 different data types.
- Use lists or dictionaries or tuples or sets.
- Use loops.
- Use functions that return an output.
- Use conditions.
- Use a Lambda function.

## Example#1: An online Grocery Store
Overview : An online store that sells fruits to customers. The customers should be able to
do the following tasks for the store to function properly.

### As a customer I should be able to do the following:
- Browse Products.
- View the product info (summary, specs, price, quantity, etc.)
- Search for Products.
- Get recommendations for my next purchase based on my purchase history.
- Add Products to the shopping cart.
- Remove a product from the shopping cart.
- List the products in my shopping cart.
- Continue to checkout.
- Fill in my address for delivery.
- Get receipt of my purchases.
- Check delivery status.

## Example#2: Strong Personal Password
Overview : A system creates personal random passwords, these passwords should be strong enough and contains capital and small letters, numbers and symbols. Therefore, you need to do the following.
- Save all letters in a list.
- Ask the user about password length.
- shuffle passwords.
- use loops to create a passsword.
- choose a random letter from letters by using random.choice.
- Add a random letter to the password.
- Write a function that add capital letters to the password.
- Write a function that add random numbers to the password.
- Write a function that add symbols to the password.
- Final Randomization to the final pattern.
- Print the Final Password.

# Use at least 3 different data types.
#1-Text Type
q1="1- What is the largest big cat?"
q2="2- What land animal can open its mouth the widest?"
q3="3- What is the largest animal on Earth?"
q4="4- What is the only flying mammal?"
q5="5- What is an animal called that eats plants and meat?"
q6="6- Why do sea otters hold hands?"

#2-Numeric Type
global score
score=0
qNum=1
global questions
questions=6

#Use lists or dictionaries or tuples or sets.
list1=["Lion","Tiger","Cheetah"]
list2=["Alligator","Baboon","Hippo"]
list3=["The African elephant","The blue whale","The giant squid"]
list4=["The bat","The flying squirrel","The bald eagle"]
list5=["Carnivore","Herbivore","Omnivore"]
list6=["To show they are in the same family","So they do not float away when they are sleeping","Because they are playing"]
